This is for the printer Creality Ender 5 Pro with the board v4.2.2.

The new thing in 2.1 is input shaper, but that is not something we are currently
using.

In the newer conf2121.h a ENDER5_USE_BLTOUCH constant is defined.

By default in conf2121 has enabled in difference to conf2097:
- LCD_BED_TRAMMING
- Z_HOMING_HEIGHT
- Z_AFTER_HOMING

When enabling BLTouch in conf2121 you only have to change: 
- Comment in "#define ENDER5_USE_BLTOUCH"
- Comment out "#define Z_MIN_PROBE_USES_Z_MIN_ENDSTOP_PIN"
- Change NOZZLE_TO_PROBE_OFFSET (this can be done afterwards)

By enabling BLTouch in conf2121 you enable:
- AUTO_BED_LEVELING_BILINEAR
- G26_MESH_VALIDATION
- LCD_BED_LEVELING
- Z_SAFE_HOMING

The NOZZLE_TO_PROBE_OFFSET has been measured to {-45, -6, ??}. Measure Z
afterwards.
